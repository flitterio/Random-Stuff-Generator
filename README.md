# Random Stuff Generator

## Welcome to the Random Stuff Generator
The Random Stuff Generator is a program that takes user input, and displays a related random image in addition to an unrelated, random piece of advice, and famous quote. 

You can access the live web app [here!](https://flitterio.github.io/Random-Stuff-Generator/) 

# How Does it Work?
To generate some random content, the user simply types anything they would like to find an image for in the search box and clicks/taps the "Let's Get RaNDoM" button to reveal their results. 
    *Please note that not all searches garner results, and the user may be prompted to type something else into the search bar*

The user can choose to see a new random result using their same input by clicking "New Result" or they can click on "Start Over" to return to the main screen and start over.

Here is an example of a different result for the same search term above, "Green":
